# Minecraft - Docker

__*Take care, `Last` version is often in dev. Use stable version with TAG*__

Docker build for managing a Minecraft Bukkit/Spigot server based on Alpine with
Dynmap module include.

This image is borrowed from bbriggs/bukkit functionalities.
Thanks for this good base of Dockerfile and existing structure.

This image uses [GetBukkit](https://getbukkit.org) to manage a Minecraft server.

## Usage

### Basic run of the server

To start the server and accept the EULA in one fell swoop, just pass the
`EULA=true` environment variable to Docker when running the container.

`docker run -it -p 25565:25565 -p 8123:8123 -e EULA=true --name minecraf_server
mdestombes/minecraft_bukkit_server`

### Spigot included

Base of container minecraft is `bukkit`, but spigot server should be run too.
To run the spigot server, supply it as an argument like so:
`docker run -it -p 25565:25565 -p 8123:8123 -e EULA=true --name minecraf_server
mdestombes/minecraft_bukkit_server spigot`

### Configuration

You should be able to pass configuration options as environment variables like
so:
`docker run -it -p 25565:25565 -p 8123:8123 -e EULA=true -e DIFFICULTY=2 -e
MOTD="A specific welcome message" -e SPAWN_ANIMALS=false --name minecraf_server
mdestombes/minecraft_bukkit_server`

This container will attempt to generate a `server.properties` file if one does
not already exist. If you would like to use the configuration tool, be sure that
you are not providing a configuration file or that you also set
`FORCE_CONFIG=true` in the environment variables.

### Environment Files

Because of the potentially large number of environment variables that you could
pass in, you might want to consider using an `environment variable file`.
Example:
```
# env.list
ALLOW_NETHER=false
level-seed=123456789
EULA=true
```

`docker run -it -p 25565:25565 -p 8123:8123 --env-file env.list --name
minecraf_server mdestombes/minecraft_bukkit_server`

### Saved run of the server

You can bring your own existing data + configuration and mount it to the `/data`
directory when starting the container by using the `-v` option.

`docker run -it -v /my/path/to/minecraft:/minecraft/data/:rw -p 25565:25565 -p
8123:8123 -e EULA=true --name minecraf_server
mdestombes/minecraft_bukkit_server`

---

## Recommended Usage

### Stopping container

To stop the server, more than 40 should be needed. 60 seconds set to internal
stop running process, to avoid lost data.

/!\ The default timeout of command `stop` from docker command is 10 second.

That's why I highly recommend to use the following parameter to use the `stop`
command :

`docker stop -t 70 minecraf_server`
